Hi, I'm Matt Diebolt. I'm the CTO at Poll Everywhere and the founder of [encoro](https://encoro.org) and [Design Eye](https://designeye.app). I care a lot about people development, feedback, entrepreneurship, and design.

I'm a long-standing Ruby on Rails supporter and have recently been having fun with Elixir using Phoenix.
